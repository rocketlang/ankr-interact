## Short Description (260 chars)

ANKR Interact is an open-source knowledge platform combining note-taking, interactive learning bundles (.ib format), AI tutoring, classrooms, and a bundle marketplace — all in one self-hosted app.

---

## Long Description

**ANKR Interact** is the open-source alternative to Obsidian + Notion + NotebookLM + Google Classroom + Duolingo + Miro — unified.

**What you get:**
- 📚 **Smart note-taking** — block editor (Tiptap), bidirectional links, knowledge graph, daily notes
- 📦 **Interactive Bundles (.ib)** — zip-based portable learning packages with docs, flashcards, quizzes, courses, AI characters, comics, and audio
- 🤖 **AI Tutor** — ask questions about your notes, get Feynman-style explanations
- 🎓 **Classrooms** — teachers create courses, assign bundles, track attendance, gamify learning
- 🌍 **23 languages** — full RTL support, Hindi voice AI, multilingual TTS
- 🏪 **Marketplace** — sell or share bundles globally (70% creator share, Razorpay)
- 📱 **Mobile-first** — Expo app with offline sync (SM-2 spaced repetition, SQLite)
- 🔒 **Self-hosted** — Apache 2.0, Docker Compose, BYOK (your own Anthropic key)
- 🆓 **Free forever** — cloud tier available at ₹299/month (Pro) or ₹999/month (Teams)

**The .ib bundle format** is our core innovation — a portable knowledge unit you can download, share, sell, or remix. Think of it as an ebook that can quiz you, teach you through a comic character, and sync to your phone.

**Built in public by ANKR Labs** — an enterprise platform company from Gurgaon, India. We eat our own dog food: all our internal training (logistics SOPs, maritime compliance, security certifications) runs on ANKR Interact.

## First Comment (Maker comment — post this immediately after launch)

Hey ProductHunt! 👋

I'm [name] from ANKR Labs in Gurgaon, India. We've been building ANKR Interact for the past 6 months — first as an internal knowledge tool for our team, then as something we wanted the world to have.

**The problem we kept hitting:** Our drivers needed trip SOPs. Our NVOCC operators needed Incoterms training. Our security team needed MITRE ATT&CK courses. We tried Notion, Obsidian, Google Classroom, Duolingo — and ended up gluing 4 different tools together with duct tape.

So we built one thing that does all of it.

**The `.ib` format** is what I'm most excited about — it's a portable knowledge bundle (just a zip) that any creator can make and any learner can import. Flashcards, quizzes, AI characters, comic strips, audio episodes — all in one file you can email, sell, or self-host.

**Free to self-host forever.** We believe knowledge infrastructure should be open source. The cloud tier helps us fund development.

Would love your feedback — especially from educators, trainers, and knowledge workers who've felt the pain of using 5 different tools for one workflow.

AMA in the comments!
