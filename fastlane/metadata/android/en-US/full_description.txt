ANKR Interact is a free, open source learning platform — think Obsidian + Duolingo + Google Classroom, but self-hostable and ad-free.

<b>LEARN WITH AI CHARACTERS</b>
Every study bundle can feature a cartoon AI tutor who narrates chapters aloud, celebrates your progress, and explains concepts through visual comic strips. Character voices are configurable — runs on your device's TTS, no internet needed.

<b>SPACED REPETITION BUILT IN</b>
Every flashcard deck uses the SM-2 algorithm — the same science behind Anki. Review cards just before you forget them. Streaks, progress bars, and XP keep you motivated.

<b>.ib BUNDLE FORMAT — OPEN & PORTABLE</b>
Study content lives in .ib files — an open ZIP format containing chapters (markdown), flashcards, MCQ quizzes, character data, comic strips, and audio. Create once, study anywhere. Bundles work fully offline after download.
